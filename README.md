# Accessibility Web Scraper

The Accessibility Web Scraper is a solution to automate the process of searching URLs using the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation tool. The idea for the project arose from the tedious and time-consuming process of manually checking every URL associated with a website, and the goal is to save developers, designers, and website managers time and promote frequent web accessibility audits.
